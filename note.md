dependecies added in client
yarn add styled-components react-router-dom@5.3.0

#### issues

# 1

Whenever I click the home, about or calender in the nav bar, my url changes but not the actual page. I need to refresh to get the components.

solution: I removed the 5.3 veriosn of react-router-dom and added the version 5th version
